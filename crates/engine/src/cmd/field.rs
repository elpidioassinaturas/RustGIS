//! Field packages (#1902): a map taken to a phone and brought back.
//!
//! A field package (`.rgisfield`) is a zip holding a project of one map, `<area> (offline)`, and
//! the files it reads beside it: the MBTiles and PMTiles archives its tile layers draw from, under
//! `basemaps/`, so the map has its basemap with no network. Packaging the active map makes an
//! offline area of it in this project first (as Download Map does), so the edits made in the
//! field can be brought back to it by feature, with the offline area's conflict handling.
//!
//! Opening a field package unpacks it into the app's own folder (`field/<name>`) and opens the
//! project there, unsaved, as a project package opens.
//!
//! Coming back, the field's map is packaged as it is, with the photos its features name (in a
//! layer's `photos` field, paths separated by `;`) under `photos/`. Bring Back Edits
//! (`offline.bringBack`) reads such a package in the project it was made from, puts its photos in
//! a folder beside that project, and copies the edits back to the area's map by feature, as Sync
//! does, saying which features were changed on both sides.
